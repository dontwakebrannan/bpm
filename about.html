            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an artist currently residing in Portland, Oregon.</p>
            <p>My childhood was largely spent somewhat removed from my peers in a small mountain canyon outside of Woodland Park, Colorado. Surrounded by ample forest and given a lot of free rein, I quickly established an affinity for the natural world. That relationship, plus the relative isolation of my upbringing has, over time, become the primary influencers of my work.</p>
            <p>With a palette of organic textures, I draw compositions comprised of familiar elements, yet present them in unsettling, unfamiliar contexts that reflect on larger themes, such as mortality or our sense of place and identity.</p>
