            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an artist currently residing in Portland, Oregon.</p>
            <p>My childhood was largely spent somewhat removed from my peers in a small mountain canyon outside of Woodland Park, Colorado. Surrounded by ample forest and given a lot of free rein, I quickly established an affinity for the natural world. That relationship with nature, plus the relative isolation of my upbringing, has over time developed to become the primary influencers of my work.</p>
            <p>With a palette of organic textures, my primary goal is to draw compositions comprised of elements that are largely familiar, yet present them in unsettling, unfamiliar contexts that lead to reflection on larger themes, such as mortality or our sense of place and identity.</p>
