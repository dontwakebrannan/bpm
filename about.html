            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a visual artist currently residing in Portland, Oregon.</p>

            <p>My childhood was largely spent somewhat removed from my peers in a small, mountain canyon outside of Woodland Park, Colorado. Surrounded by beautiful forest and provided ample free rein, I quickly established an affinity for the natural world and its many textures. That close relationship with nature, plus the relatively isolated perspective of my formative years have, over time, become the primary influencers of my work, and the lens through which I view the world.</p>
            <p>With a palette of organic textures, I draw compositions comprised of familiar elements, and present them in unsettling, unfamiliar contexts that reflect on larger themes of isolation, location, and belonging.</p>
